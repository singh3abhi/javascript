 * Abstract Operations
 * 1. There are some set of algorithms, that is present in the ecmascript docs
 * but they are not available for usage in ecmascript
 * i.e we as developers cannot use these operations directly
 *
 * 2. They are mentioned in the docs to aid (help) the documentation only
 * In the ecmascript docs there are a lot of things that are done by the
 * language internally. To explain these internal details of how & what
 * language is doing, we have abstract operations mentioned in the docs
